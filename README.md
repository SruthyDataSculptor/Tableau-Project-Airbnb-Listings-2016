Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb listings from 2016 using Tableau to analyze pricing trends, geographic distribution, and revenue insights. The dashboard provides a data-driven understanding of how various factors, such as the number of bedrooms, zip codes, and time, influence listing prices.

Key Insights
1. Price Analysis by Bedrooms
The average price increases with the number of bedrooms.
Single-bedroom listings have an average price of $96.2, while 6-bedroom properties reach $584.8.
There is a significant jump in price beyond 4 bedrooms, indicating a premium for larger accommodations.
2. Distribution of Listings by Bedrooms
1-bedroom listings dominate the market (1,811 listings), followed by 2-bedroom listings (483).
Larger properties (4+ bedrooms) are relatively rare, suggesting they cater to a niche market.
3. Pricing by Zip Code
The most expensive zip codes have higher average prices, reflecting demand in prime locations.
Certain areas show lower listing prices, likely due to less tourist demand or competitive pricing strategies.
4. Revenue Trends Over Time
Consistent revenue growth is observed throughout the year.
Revenue peaks around February-April and stabilizes, indicating potential seasonality.
Insights from this trend can help Airbnb hosts optimize pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations.
Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, investors, and market analysts. It highlights pricing trends, demand variations, and market dynamics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
